description: Build or refresh the .context knowledge graph for a scope, detect duplicate clusters, and synthesize a consolidation brief for human approval. Single entry point; classifies scope and runs the smallest honest pass. Never rewrites code.
argument-hint: [scope]
---

`scope` (optional) decides the size of the run. Classify it:

- **specific** — a pattern family name (`modais`, `cards`, `filters`): build/refresh
  only that `patterns/<x>.yaml` (+ its tree, if earned) and flag its forks.
- **domain** — a domain path or name (`src/despesas`, `despesas`): one
  `domains/<x>.yaml` plus the patterns that domain uses.
- **whole** — no argument: the full graph, with duplicate detection looping until
  it runs dry.

Everything lives under `.context/` at the repo root (create it if absent). Process
bookkeeping lives at `.context/status.json` and `.context/_crystallize/`; the graph
files (`domains/`, `patterns/`, `trees/`, `index/`, `manifest.yaml`, `onboarding.yaml`)
stay pristine for day-to-day agents.

## Step 0 — load or init status.json

Read `.context/status.json` (schema below). Create it with defaults if absent.

```json
{
  "scope": "<specific|domain|whole>:<name or whole-repo>",
  "phases": {
    "map":  { "lastRun": null, "fileHashes": {} },
    "mine": { "lastRun": null, "fileHashes": {} },
    "diff": { "lastRun": null, "fileHashes": {} }
  },
  "gate": "pending",
  "clusters": [],
  "nextSuggestedCommand": null
}
```

**Staleness:** for each phase already run, recompute `shasum -a 256` for its
`fileHashes` and compare. Any mismatch, or new in-scope files absent from `map`'s
hashes, makes that phase and every later phase stale — they must re-run.

## Step 1 — map (Tier-1 skeleton; if missing or stale)

Invoke `context-mapper` for the scope. Pass it the current timestamp for
`generated_at` (never let it invent one). Write:
- `.context/index/components.generated.yaml` (its GENERATED_INDEX)
- the SYSTEM_MAP_SKELETON into `.context/manifest.yaml#system_map`

Update `status.json` `phases.map`.

## Step 2 — mine (intent; if missing or stale, or map re-ran)

Invoke `intent-extractor` for the scope, passing it the generated index as a map
of where to look. Keep its BUSINESS_INTENT and UI_INTENT as working input under
`.context/_crystallize/` — this is proposal material, not yet graph.

Update `status.json` `phases.mine`.

## Step 3 — diff (duplicate clusters; if missing or stale, or mine re-ran)

Invoke `duplicate-detector`, passing the generated index + both intent tracks.
Write its VARIATIONS to `.context/_crystallize/VARIATIONS.md`. Parse each
`#### Cluster: <cluster-id>` into `status.json.clusters` as
`{ id, intent, mechanism, mass, risk, status: "pending" }`, preserving the
`status` of any cluster-id already present (never reset an `applied` cluster).

For a **whole** scope, loop map→mine→diff until two consecutive diff rounds add no
new cluster (loop-until-dry). For **specific**/**domain**, one pass is enough.

Update `status.json` `phases.diff`.

## Step 4 — referee (make Tier-2 true)

Before anything curated is proposed, verify. For each cluster and each candidate
canonical claim (its `extends`/base, its consumer counts, its "these instances
are equivalent"), invoke `claim-referee` — one claim per referee. Drop or correct
every claim the referee refutes/corrects. Only verified claims proceed.

## Step 5 — synthesize the brief (only when map, mine, diff are all fresh)

If any phase just re-ran due to staleness, stop and report what refreshed; re-run
`/crystallize` once to confirm nothing changed, then continue. (If Steps 1–3
changed nothing, continue immediately.)

Invoke `context-architect` with the verified clusters + intent. Write its
PROPOSED_* blocks into `.context/_crystallize/CRYSTALLIZE_BRIEF.md` (not yet into
the live graph). The brief is: the proposed patterns/trees/index/domains, the
over-engineering self-review, and the open questions.

Set `gate` to `"pending"` (or leave `"approved"`/`"partially_applied"` as-is; if it
was already `"approved"` and new clusters appeared, flag that to the user — a
regenerated brief does not silently re-approve). Set `nextSuggestedCommand` to
`"review .context/_crystallize/CRYSTALLIZE_BRIEF.md and approve"`.

## Step 6 — present and stop

Summarize the brief: scope, top clusters by mass, which pattern families earned a
decision tree and which didn't, open questions. **Enter plan mode if supported and
stop — write nothing into the live graph until the user approves.** Approving means
the user names which clusters/nodes are accepted; on their confirmation, promote
the approved Tier-2 blocks from the brief into `.context/` (patterns, trees,
curated index, domains, manifest registry) and mark those clusters `"approved"` in
`status.json`. Only then can `/crystallize-apply` run.

After promoting anything into the live graph, run the validator and report its
result — a promoted node that points at a file which doesn't exist is a lie the
graph must not keep:

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate-context.py" --context .context --repo .
```

If it reports errors (dangling paths, unresolved references), fix them before
declaring the run done — do not leave the graph in a failing state.
